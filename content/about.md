> Design has no method. Design is method.

I work at the intersection of design and technology, where observation meets implementation and where complexity must justify its presence.

## Philosophy

I believe in:

- **Observation before opinion** — understanding how people actually behave, not how systems expect them to
- **Simplicity as respect** — for attention, for time, for the limits of cognition
- **Code as material** — not constraint, but medium to think through
- **Ethics as foundation** — technology should serve people, not extract from them

## Practice

My work spans interaction design, web components, and design systems. I build tools that disappear into use — that enable intention rather than demand attention.

Current focus: creating interfaces that respect the body's relationship to screens, and systems that remain stable under change.

## This Site

Built with a minimal foundation: semantic HTML, modular CSS, and a custom web component for synchronized scroll-based reading.

The content is markdown. The structure is discoverable. The code is readable.

Nothing more than necessary. Nothing less than sufficient.
