# There Are No Problems

![Water has no problems](https://picsum.photos/seed/no-problems-hero/800/600 "cover")

From school to studio to industry, we are sold the same story: designers are problem solvers.

It is on the job postings. It is in the portfolios. It is the frame through which we learn to see our own work — here was the problem, here was the process, here was the solution. A neat arc. A satisfying closure. A deliverable.

This story is a lie.

Not a malicious lie. A limiting one. A frame so narrow that it amputates most of what design could be, reducing it to the shipping of screens and the pushing of pixels. Problem-solving is not the heart of design. It is the coffin.

## The Invention of Problems

Problems do not exist in nature.

This sounds absurd until you look closely. A river meets a rock. Is this a problem? The river does not experience it as one. The river flows around, over, through. The rock shapes the current; the current shapes the rock. Neither is solved. Both continue.

![River and rock](https://picsum.photos/seed/river-rock/800/600)

A problem is a human construct — a name we give to the friction that arises when our intentions meet resistance. We want to go straight; the rock is in the way. We declare the rock a problem because we have already decided what should happen, and the rock disagrees.

> Problems are not found. They are manufactured by the collision between expectation and reality.

The resistance is real. The rock is real. But "problem" is an interpretation, a framing, a story we tell about the relationship between what is and what we want.

This distinction matters. When we name something a problem, we commit to solving it — to removing the obstacle, to forcing the path we intended. When we see the same situation as terrain, we commit to navigating — to finding the path that wants to exist.

## The Legacy in the Way

Most of my career has been spent in digital. And most of the "problems" I was hired to solve, when I drilled down to root causes, turned out to be the same thing: legacy.

Not legacy as in old code — though sometimes that. Legacy as in the residue of past decisions. Processes that made sense once and calcified. Hierarchies that served a purpose now forgotten. Systems designed for contexts that no longer exist, still running because no one has permission to stop them.

![Legacy terrain](https://picsum.photos/seed/legacy-terrain/800/600)

The rock in the river.

The instinct, the trained instinct, is to solve. To move the rock. To refactor the code, reorganize the hierarchy, redesign the process. And sometimes this works. Humans are ingenious. The Egyptians piled immense stones into pyramids through nothing but intelligence and will.

But in our context, we are not building pyramids. We are not trying to pile legacy higher. We are trying to reach something beyond it. And for that, moving the rock is rarely the answer.

> The rock does not need to move. You need to flow.

## The Path of Least Resistance

Water does not solve rocks. Water does not have a problem with rocks. Water encounters resistance and responds — not by forcing, but by finding.

The path of least resistance is not cowardice. It is intelligence. It is the recognition that energy spent fighting the immovable is energy not spent reaching the destination.

![Path finding](https://picsum.photos/seed/path-finding/800/600)

When I face legacy — the system that cannot change, the process that will not bend, the hierarchy that refuses to see — I no longer ask how to solve it. I ask: where is the flow?

Where can progress happen without permission? What can be built alongside rather than instead? Which battles can be declined so that energy remains for the ones that matter?

This is not compromise. This is strategy. The water that flows around the rock still reaches the sea. And given enough time, given enough persistence, the water that flows begins to shape what it flows around.

> You cannot erode a problem. Problems have no body. But you can erode obstacles, if you have the patience to keep flowing.

## The Death of Practice

"Problem-solving" kills design because it narrows the gaze.

When you are solving, you are fixated on the problem. You see the rock. You measure the rock. You brainstorm techniques for rock removal. The entire field of vision contracts to the obstacle and the effort to overcome it.

![Narrow gaze](https://picsum.photos/seed/narrow-gaze/800/600)

You stop seeing the river. You forget where it was going. You lose the current, the banks, the ecosystem of which the rock is one small part. The problem becomes the world, and the world shrinks to the problem.

This is how design becomes pixel-pushing. Not through lack of skill, but through excess of focus. We solve the button. We solve the flow. We solve the conversion metric. Each solution is a victory, and the victories accumulate, and somehow the product is worse — because no one was watching the river.

Systems thinking requires soft eyes. The ability to see the whole while attending to the part. The willingness to let "problems" blur into terrain, into context, into the thousand relationships that determine whether any intervention helps or harms.

> The designer who sees only problems will solve themselves into a corner. The designer who sees flow will find the sea.

## Yin and Yang Are Not Enemies

The Western frame is Manichean. Good versus evil. Problem versus solution. Two forces in opposition, one to be defeated so the other can triumph.

This is not how reality works.

![Yin and yang](https://picsum.photos/seed/yin-yang/800/600)

Yin and yang are not enemies. They are not even separate. Look at the symbol — each contains the seed of the other, and the boundary between them is not a wall but a flow. They create each other. They require each other. The existence of one is the condition for the existence of the other.

Water and stone are like this.

Water falls on mountains. It seeps into cracks, freezes, expands, breaks rock into smaller rock. Over millennia, water creates stones — the boulders, the pebbles, the sand. Water is the sculptor of the mountains it descends.

And stone shapes water. The riverbed determines the current. The canyon walls give the flow its power. Without resistance, water spreads flat, loses force, goes nowhere. Stone is what makes water a river instead of a puddle.

> The obstacle is not opposed to the flow. The obstacle is what gives the flow its shape.

When we frame design as problem-solving, we import the Manichean error. Problem bad, solution good. Remove the problem, declare victory. But the problem was never separate from the context that created it, and the solution that "removes" it often just shifts the friction elsewhere.

Flow does not remove. Flow incorporates. Flow finds the relationship between resistance and movement that allows both to continue. The rock stays. The water passes. And both are changed by the encounter.

## What Designers Actually Do

If not problem-solving, then what?

I have come to believe that designers are sense-makers. We encounter situations — messy, tangled, resistant — and we find ways through. Not solutions that eliminate mess, but paths that navigate it. Not answers that resolve tension, but forms that hold tension productively.

![Sense-making](https://picsum.photos/seed/sense-making/800/600)

The product that works is not the one that solved all problems. It is the one that found a flow — a way of being in the world that accommodates reality rather than denying it. Users bring their own rocks, their own currents, their own intentions. The product that flows can meet them where they are. The product that "solved" can only meet them where it decided they should be.

This is why prototyping matters more than specification. Specification is problem-solving: define the problem, design the solution, build the definition. Prototyping is flow: encounter the terrain, feel the resistance, adjust and continue. One is a plan imposed. The other is a path discovered.

> Design is not the removal of obstacles. Design is the art of flowing despite them.

## Erasing the Word

I am not suggesting we never intervene. Water intervenes constantly — it carries sediment, deposits deltas, carves canyons. Action is not the opposite of flow. Forcing is.

The intervention that flows is the one that works with the situation rather than against it. That finds leverage where leverage exists. That accepts what cannot change and focuses energy on what can.

![Erasing the frame](https://picsum.photos/seed/erasing-frame/800/600)

The intervention that forces is the one that insists on the original intention regardless of what the terrain reveals. That spends resources moving rocks that could be flowed around. That declares victory over problems while creating new ones downstream.

The difference is not in the action. It is in the frame.

And so I propose, as practice, erasing the word. Stop saying "problem." Stop thinking in problems. When the obstacle appears, do not name it. Naming is the first step toward fixation, and fixation is the first step toward forcing.

Instead, ask: what is the terrain? Where is the resistance? And where, around or through or over, is the flow?

> Problems have no body. You cannot erode what you cannot touch. But obstacles are real, and real things yield to persistence.

## The River Reaches the Sea

I no longer introduce myself as a problem-solver. The phrase feels like a cage now, a frame that shrinks what I do into something measurable and sellable and small.

What I do is harder to name. I observe. I feel for current. I sense where movement wants to happen and where it is blocked. I find paths. Sometimes I find that the path requires patience, and I wait. Sometimes I find that the path requires force, and I push. But the force is always in service of flow, never in opposition to terrain.

![Reaching the sea](https://picsum.photos/seed/reaching-sea/800/600)

The rocks remain. Most of them will outline me. The legacies, the hierarchies, the calcified processes — they are not mine to move. They are simply the landscape I move through.

And the river reaches the sea. Not by solving the mountains, but by descending them. Not by removing obstacles, but by incorporating them into the shape of its becoming.

This is what design can be when we stop calling it problem-solving.

Flow finding its way.

Water becoming river.

The path that was always there, waiting to be discovered.
