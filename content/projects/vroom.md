# Vroom

![A wooden car waiting](https://picsum.photos/seed/vroom-hero/800/600 "cover")

I am sitting in a park, watching.

A child runs to the bench where her father sits. She holds up a stick — a wand, perhaps, or a sword, or something that has no name yet because she is still deciding. She wants him to see. She wants him to play.

He glances up from his phone. "That's nice, honey." His eyes return to the screen. His thumb continues scrolling.

She waits. The stick lowers. She walks back to the grass, alone.

If you ask him later, he will say he was handling something important. Perhaps he was. But I have watched this scene repeat across a hundred benches, a thousand playgrounds, and I no longer believe the phones hold what we claim they hold.

## The Price of Peace

On the subway, a different scene.

A mother, exhausted in the way that needs no explanation. A child beside her, restless, loud, beginning to cry. The carriage full of strangers who do not want to hear it.

She reaches into her bag. Pulls out a phone. Hands it to the child.

Silence. Relief. Peace purchased.

![The transaction](https://picsum.photos/seed/peace-purchased/800/600)

I do not judge her. I have no right. The transaction makes sense: a device that guarantees quiet, that buys minutes of rest, that transforms a public problem into a private screen. Every parent has made this trade.

But I wonder what we are trading away.

The child who learns that discomfort is solved by device. The parent who learns that attention can be outsourced. The slow replacement of presence with provision — I cannot be with you right now, but here is something that will fill the space.

The phone is not the villain. The phone is the symptom. The villain is the exhaustion, the isolation, the impossible demands we place on parents who have no village, no support, no margin. The phone simply fills the vacuum we have created.

But still. I wonder what else might fill it.

## What Boredom Used to Build

When I was a child, boredom was unavoidable.

No device to reach for. No stream to scroll. Just time — empty, uncomfortable, mine.

A matchbox and a wine cork. That was enough. The matchbox became a car. The cork became a driver, then a building, then a mountain the car had to climb. The story grew because nothing else was offered. The imagination fired because nothing else would.

![Matchbox and cork](https://picsum.photos/seed/matchbox-cork/800/600)

I remember the adults who worried about my sudden silence. Who came to check and found me on the floor, deep in a world that existed nowhere but my own construction. Some of them made the mistake of asking what I was doing. Some of them made the wiser choice of sitting down and joining.

Those who joined became part of the story. The car needed a passenger. The mountain needed a dragon. The game expanded to include them, and for a while, we were somewhere together that screens could never reach.

> Boredom is not emptiness. It is an invitation.

Digital toys refuse this invitation. They are full — of sounds, of lights, of correct answers and progress bars. They do not leave room for invention because they have already invented everything. The child's role is to respond, not to create.

And so the muscle of imagination weakens. The tolerance for emptiness shrinks. The matchbox stays a matchbox, because why would you pretend when the device pretends for you?

## A Shape That Asks Questions

The wooden car I designed has no doors. No windows. No driver.

This is not minimalism for its own sake. It is space left open.

![Vroom form](https://picsum.photos/seed/vroom-form/800/600)

A detailed toy is a closed question. Here is a fire truck; it fights fires. Here is a race car; it goes fast. The story is given. The child's job is to enact what the object has already decided.

An abstract toy is an open question. Here is a shape with wheels. What is it? Where does it go? Who drives it?

The answer changes with mood, with moment, with the presence or absence of a dragon that needs chasing. The same object becomes a hundred different stories because the object does not insist on being any single one.

> Simplicity is not absence. It is permission.

The constraints were deliberate. Locally sourced wood — oak, beech, what the region provides. A shape simple enough that time and trend cannot date it. Handles curved to fit a child's grip, to feel natural in the hand, to invite holding rather than require it.

The bottom tapers at front and back. This is not decoration. Push the car like a friction toy, and the taper lifts it slightly, prevents scratching, makes the glide smooth. Function shaping form, as it should.

What remains is an object. Sturdy. Clean. The kind of thing a grandmother might recognize from her own childhood, even though it was made yesterday.

## The Bridge

But what if the object could be more?

Not more in the way of features. More in the way of connection.

The wooden car holds an NFC chip. Invisible. No battery, no screen, no indication that technology lives inside. The car is still just a car, simple enough for any story.

![The hidden bridge](https://picsum.photos/seed/hidden-bridge/800/600)

Until you tap it to a phone.

Then the car reveals a hidden dimension. Not a game that replaces play — a space that extends it. The sound of an engine, a horn, tires on gravel. The car in the hand and the sound in the air, the physical and the digital meeting in one moment of shared magic.

But the phone belongs to the parent.

This matters. The child cannot unlock the dimension alone. The parent must be present, must participate, must enter the play rather than handing it off. The technology is not a babysitter. It is a bridge — and bridges require someone on both sides.

> The toy does not need the phone. The phone needs the parent.

What opens is not distraction. It is collaboration. Take a picture together, the car posed in some impossible landscape. Record a sound — the child's own "vroom" — and now the car plays it back. Fill a passport with stamps from places visited, the car as traveling companion, witness to adventure.

The screen becomes not the destination but the doorway. And what waits on the other side is not content. It is each other.

## Presence as the Feature

The car can be played with forever without ever touching a phone. This is essential.

The object must stand alone. Must be complete. Must offer everything a child needs for a thousand hours of imagination without any electronic enhancement.

![Complete without addition](https://picsum.photos/seed/complete-alone/800/600)

The NFC is not what makes the car valuable. Presence is what makes the car valuable — the presence of wood in hand, of story in mind, of parent beside.

The digital layer exists only to invite that presence. To give the parent a reason to put down their own phone and pick up the child's toy. To create a moment where attention flows not to the screen but through it, using technology to escape technology's grip.

This is the inversion that matters: most digital toys pull children toward screens. This one pulls parents toward play.

> The hidden dimension is not in the phone. It is in the moment the phone creates.

And when the moment passes, the phone goes away. The car remains. The memory remains. The story continues with hands and imagination, as it always has, as it should.

## What Lasts

Toys break. Toys are outgrown. Toys are discarded when the next thing arrives.

I wanted to make something that lasts.

![Generational object](https://picsum.photos/seed/generational/800/600)

Not lasts in the way of durability — though the car is durable, oak and beech shaped to survive being thrown, dropped, loved roughly as children love. Lasts in the way of relevance. Lasts in the way of meaning.

A shape that carries no date cannot become dated. A material that ages cannot become obsolete. Fifty years from now, the same car will feel the same in a child's hand, will invite the same open stories, will wait for the same imagination to bring it alive.

And perhaps, by then, it will carry something more.

The photos taken with a parent who is now a grandparent. The sounds recorded in a voice that has aged. The passport stamps from trips that have become legends. The layers of memory pressed into an object, invisible as the NFC chip, present as the wood's weight.

> The toy is not the legacy. The play is the legacy. The toy is just what holds it.

Pass the car to the next generation. They will not know what it meant to you. They will discover what it means to them. The same object, the same invitation, the same open question — what is this, where does it go, who will you be while you hold it?

This is what digital cannot offer. Devices are replaced, ecosystems sunset, apps lose support. But a piece of wood, shaped well, cared for, carries forward. And what it carries is not data. It is the weight of having been held.

## Back to the Park

I return to the bench. The father, the phone, the child with her stick.

I imagine a different version.

She runs to him. He sees the car in her hand — the one they chose together, the one with the scratch from the Great Mountain Adventure of last Tuesday. He reaches for his phone, but not to scroll. He taps. The engine sound plays. She laughs.

![The moment changed](https://picsum.photos/seed/moment-changed/800/600)

"Where are we going today?"

She looks at the stick. A wand, maybe. Or the key to a castle the car must reach.

"Far," she says. "Very far."

He puts the phone in his pocket. Sits on the grass beside her. Becomes the dragon, or the mountain, or whatever the story needs.

The car goes nowhere. The car goes everywhere.

And for a moment, they are somewhere together that screens could never reach.
