# TODO

## Components

- [ ] Create a `toolbar` component with LTR/RTL icon order direction support for better reusability and accessibility
  - Should handle handedness toggle automatically
  - Icons should reflow based on reading direction
  - Reusable across site-header, panel-header, and future toolbars
